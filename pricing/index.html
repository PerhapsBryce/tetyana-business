                    Tetyana Guthrie offers a comprehensive piano program that 
                    caters to students of all levels. With over 20 years of 
                    experience teaching, she has the expertise to guide students 
                    from the very beginning to a professional level. Through the 
                    12-week sessions, students will not only learn essential piano 
                    skills such as sight-reading and chord recognition but also 
                    receive a thorough education in music theory and history. The 
                    program runs year-round and includes 12-week sessions that 
                    culminate in a mandatory recital where students are expected 
                    to perform at least four memorized pieces. Classes are tailored 
                    to beginners with 60-minute intervals($60) and intermediate to 
                    advanced students with 90-120 ($90-$120) minute intervals. 
                    Whether you are just starting out or looking to refine your 
                    skills, Tetyana Guthrie's piano program is designed to help you 
                    reach your full potential
