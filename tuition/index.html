                    Tetyana Guthrie offers a comprehensive piano program that 
                    caters to students of all levels. With over 20 years of 
                    experience teaching, she has the expertise to guide students 
                    from the very beginning to a professional level. Through the 
                    12-week sessions, students will not only learn essential piano 
                    skills such as sight-reading and chord recognition but also 
                    receive a thorough education in music theory and history. The 
                    program runs year-round and includes 12-week sessions that 
                    culminate in a mandatory recital where students are expected 
                    to perform at least four memorized pieces. Classes are tailored 
                    to the student, with 30 minute intervals, 45 minute 
                    intervals, 60 minute intervals, or 90 minute 
                    intervals. The payment of each student is expected 
                    on the 1st of each month for the total four sessions in 
                    advance to ensure the student's time is reserved. On 
                    request by the student or in the event of inclement 
                    weather, the sessions can be conducted online via Zoom. 
                    Should the student need to cancel a class, they should 
                    inform me no less than 24 hours in advance in order to be 
                    able to make up the class.  Whether you are just starting 
                    out or looking to refine your skills, Tetyana Guthrie's 
                    piano program is designed to help you reach your full 
                    potential!
