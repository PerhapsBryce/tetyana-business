        <span class="top-quote">"</span>Tetyana has not only demonstrated remarkable musical talent but has also
        brought a wealth of worldly experiences to the classroom. Her unique
        background and diverse experiences have added a valuable dimension to
        the learning environment. Tetyana has a way of connecting her love of
        music with broader cultural contexts which make her classroom rich and
        vibrant.<br /><br />
        As a brilliant musician, Tetyana's passion for her art is evident in the
        way she brings music to life for her students. Her commitment to
        excellence is reflected in her teaching methods, which are both
        innovative and engaging. Tetyana goes beyond the conventional
        approaches, incorporating interactive activities, multimedia resources,
        and hands-on experiences to ensure that her students not only understand
        but also appreciate the beauty of music.<br /><br />
        One of Tetyana's notable strengths is her genuine love for her students.
        She fosters a supportive learning environment where every student feels
        valued and inspired to explore their musical potential. Tetyana is
        committed to each student reaching their full potential in her
        classroom. On numerous occasions, I have seen her working tirelessly one
        on one with students to help them master a concept.<br /><br />
        Moreover, Tetyana's commitment to providing a holistic musical education
        is evident in her efforts to expose students to various art forms,
        including dance and theater. By integrating these elements into her
        lessons, she broadens her students' horizons and helps them develop a
        well-rounded appreciation for the arts.<br/><br />

        <span class="top-quote">"</span>My son has had Tetyana for about a year as a teacher, we have had other
        piano teachers before, but Tetyana is by far our favorite. Her
        credentials alone make us feel like we made the right decision. At my
        teenage sons age, kids have many hobbies and extracurricular activities
        that come and go, but his desire to play the piano has remained. I
        believe that has a lot to do with Tetyana. She is firm but fair,
        disciplined but encouraging. My son never feels like he is failing but
        knows that he can try harder and achieve because Tetyana says he can.<br /><br />
        Also, I would say every lesson feels like he is her only concern and top
        priority, whereas other teachers we have had you feel like your kid is
        on an assembly line and it on to the next student. NOT with Tetyana she
        really puts effort into your kid. <br /><br />I've sat in on every class and
        it's amazing to see the progress my son has made and knowledge he has
        gained learning to play the piano, the discipline he has learned being a
        musician and how to apply that to everyday life.<br /><br />
        Tetyana is an awesome teacher that I would highly recommend to anyone!!!

        <span class="top-quote">"</span>It's not often that I take time to write a review, but I feel so strongly about our time with
        Tetyana that I thought I'd take a moment and share our experience.</br><br />
        I have quite a gaggle of kids, and between moves and life events we have run the ,gamut
        of piano teachers. As in all things, there is a broad range of capability out there, and it
        takes some time to find the right one.<br/><br /> To me, teaching an instrument to kids is a fine balance of kindness and empathy,
        coupled with firmness and maintaining expectations of the students. I am not trying to
        raise concert pianists, but I would like for my children to get to a point that they can
        enjoy playing the instrument for the rest of their lives, not just talk about how when
        they were young, they took lessons. To accomplish that, we need a teacher that is
        committed to them and their growth, and to helping them do their part to develop the
        craft.<br/><br />
        Tetyana is not teaching lessons, she's teaching our kids to be pianists. I'm amused by
        how often she loses track of time in the lessons as she works to help them grasp a
        section of the song, or a specific technique. She sincerely wants them to learn, and to
        have a real appreciation for what it takes and a real desire to do this well. I am honestly
        astounded at the progress my kids have made with her in such a short time - we have
        not experienced such a thing with other teachers.<br/><br />
        I also appreciate that she doesn't pretend like they're doing great when they're not. She
        can tell when they haven't practiced and while she's always encouraging, she also holds
        them accountable to their commitments they've made to practice each day. I
        appreciate that not just from a piano teacher, but as an adult helping me teach my kids
        what it takes to make it in this crazy world.<br/><br />
        So, in every way I would genuinely recommend Tetyana. She has been the right answer
        for my 5 kids who are taking lessons from her. They know she cares about them and
        wants to help them, and they know what she expects - and she has a way of helping
        them choose to ris.e to the occasion. She is remarkable<br/><br />
